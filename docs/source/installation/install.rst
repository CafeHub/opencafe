===================
Install from Source
===================

Currently OpenCAFE is not available on PyPI *(coming soon)*. As a result, you will need to install via pip through either cloning the repository or downloading a snapshot archive.

Install from PyPI (Recommended)
===============================

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install opencafe

Install from Source
===================

The preferred method of installing OpenCAFE is using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone Repository
    git clone git@github.com:CafeHub/opencafe.git

    # Change current directory
    cd opencafe

    # Install OpenCAFE
    pip install . --upgrade

If you don't wish to use Git, then you can `download <https://github.com/CafeHub/opencafe/archive/master.zip>`_ and uncompress a snapshot archive in place of cloning the repository.
